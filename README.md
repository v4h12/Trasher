# Trasher

## Meet Trasher

Trasher is a basic CLI program made with python that manages your trash and makes in simple.

**How to Install:**

- Start off by git cloning the repository
- CD into 'Trasher'
- Startup the install script with './install.sh'
- Then Bob's your uncle, you're ready to go!

**The way it works:**

- Type 'trasher' into your terminal, the program will start and immediately list any files or directories in your trash.
- You can decide whether you want to restore or delete anything with 'r/d'.
- Either select all or individual files which are numbered within the list.
- Type in which number you'd like to restore or delete and hit enter to let Trasher do its thing!

**Note**
~ any files that are protected through root privileges or permissions can be deleted with 'sudo trasher' or you will be prompted with your password when you are at that point.

**To Add:**

- I plan on adding a TUI version with the curses library... More to come.
- There is also a plan on adding in flags for more specific usage of Trasher

**Inspiration**
This is my very first actual project that I have created from scratch, I have spent the past year learning python - having no previous coding experience. It has been quite the journey so far and these projects are what I enjoy making - something useful, simple and fun!
In lieu of the many free resources I myself have used, i thought it would only be fitting to give something in return, regardless of how small it may be.

Please feel free to make any suggestions, pull requests or anything - it will all be appreciated.
